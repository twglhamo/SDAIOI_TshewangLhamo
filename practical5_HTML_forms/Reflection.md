# Reflection on the Hostel Maintenance Request Form Project

Things I Learned:

Creating the Hostel Maintenance Request Form helped me understand how HTML forms work in real situations where users need to submit information. I learned how to use different input types such as text, email, number, radio buttons, select menus, and textareas to collect specific data from users. This project also taught me how form attributes like required, min, and max help ensure valid and accurate input before submission.

New Skills or Knowledge Acquired:

Learned how to structure a complete form using <form> along with labels and input fields.

Understood how to use different input types — text fields, number fields, dropdown menus, radio buttons, and textareas.

Gained experience using validation attributes like required, min, max, and type to control what kind of information the user can enter.

Practiced organizing information in a clear order: personal details, room details, issue type, priority, and description.

Learned how select menus improve user experience by offering predefined options.

Challenges Faced and How They Were Overcome:

One challenge I faced was ensuring that every input field had the correct ID and name values so the form could function properly. Some fields such as "student id" and "room number" needed adjustments because IDs cannot contain spaces. I fixed this by rewriting them in a consistent format. Another challenge was making the layout readable without any CSS design. I overcame this by using proper labels, line breaks, and spacing to make the form look organized and user-friendly. This assignment strengthened my understanding of form creation and improved my ability to design real-life data collection forms using HTML.
