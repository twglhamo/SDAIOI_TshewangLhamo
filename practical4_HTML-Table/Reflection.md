# Reflection on the HTML Table Activity

Things I Learned:

Creating this simple HTML table helped me understand how tables are structured using tags like <table>, <tr>, <th>, and <td>. I learned how rows and columns work together to organize information clearly, and how using a border makes the table easier to read. This activity gave me practice in presenting data in a clean and structured format.

New Skills or Knowledge Acquired:

Learned how to create a table using HTML and how each tag contributes to the layout.

Understood the difference between header cells (<th>) and regular data cells (<td>).

Learned how to group information into rows to display names and departments side by side.

Gained experience adding basic styling using the border attribute to make the table visible and more organized.

Challenges Faced and How They Were Overcome:

One challenge I faced was ensuring that the table was neatly aligned and easy to understand. At first, I struggled with remembering which tags belonged to rows and which ones held the actual data. By reviewing the table structure and practicing each tag step by step, I was able to fix the alignment and complete the table correctly. This exercise helped me become more comfortable with HTML table formatting and improved my confidence in displaying structured data on a webpage.
