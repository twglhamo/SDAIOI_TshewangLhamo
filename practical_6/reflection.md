 # Reflection on the Portfolio Webpage Project

Things I Learned:

Creating my portfolio webpage taught me how different HTML elements and external CSS work together to build a complete, structured, and visually appealing website. I learned how to design multiple sections—such as navigation, home, about, skills, and portfolio—and link them smoothly using anchor tags. This assignment also helped me understand the importance of grouping content using <section> tags and creating reusable components like skill cards and project items.

New Skills or Knowledge Acquired:

Improved my ability to build a full webpage layout using semantic HTML tags.

Learned how to create a navigation bar with links that allow users to jump to different sections of the page.

Gained experience organizing content into containers, cards, and galleries for better structure.

Learned how external CSS files can be used to consistently style multiple sections of a website.

Understood how images, headings, and buttons combine to make a section (like a hero or portfolio preview) more engaging.

Challenges Faced and How They Were Overcome:

One challenge I encountered was ensuring that the layout remained visually balanced and well-organized as I added more sections and project cards. At first, some sections felt too crowded or uneven. I solved this by using container divs and keeping the structure consistent across all parts of the page. Another difficulty was managing the navigation links and making sure each section had the correct ID so the menu could scroll smoothly. I also had to experiment with image placement and card formatting to make the portfolio grid look neat. Through these challenges, I gained confidence in organizing larger webpages and applying clean, readable structure to my HTML code.

# Reflection on the CSS Styling for My Portfolio Website

Things I Learned:

While creating the CSS stylesheet for my portfolio website, I gained a much deeper understanding of how CSS controls layout, design, and user interaction. I learned how to use global styles, flexbox, grid layouts, spacing, colors, and hover effects to make the webpage visually appealing and user-friendly. Writing this CSS file helped me see how structure and styling work together to improve the overall user experience of a portfolio website.

New Skills or Knowledge Acquired:

Learned how to use the universal selector (*) to reset default browser styles for a cleaner layout.

Used flexbox to structure the navigation bar and align elements horizontally.

Gained experience using CSS Grid to organize multiple sections like hero, about, skills, and portfolio.

Learned how to design reusable components such as skill cards and project cards using box-shadow, padding, and border-radius.

Practiced adding hover animations using transform and transition to make the website feel more interactive.

Understood how media queries help make the website responsive on smaller screens.

Challenges Faced and How They Were Overcome:

One challenge I faced was making sure the layout remained consistent across different screen sizes. At first, the navigation bar and gallery section did not align properly when viewed on smaller devices. I solved this by adding a media query and adjusting the flex and grid structure for mobile screens. Another difficulty was choosing appropriate spacing and shadows to make the skill cards and project boxes appear balanced without cluttering the page. I achieved a cleaner design through trial and error, adjusting padding, margins, and shadows until the layout looked polished. This project helped me understand the importance of visual hierarchy, spacing, and responsiveness in modern web design.
