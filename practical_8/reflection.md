# Reflection on the DOM Practice Activity

Things I Learned:

While working on this DOM practice activity, I learned how HTML elements can be prepared and structured so they can later be manipulated using JavaScript. Creating IDs, classes, and different sections helped me understand how the DOM (Document Object Model) works behind the scenes. I also realized how important it is to use proper tags and attributes so that JavaScript can easily select and modify page content.

New Skills or Knowledge Acquired:

Learned the importance of using IDs for specific element targeting (e.g., buttons and titles).

Understood how classes like .content and .highlight help group and style multiple elements.

Learned how to create a structure suitable for DOM manipulation through buttons like Change Text, Add New Element, and Remove Last Element.

Gained a better understanding of linking external JavaScript files using <script src="script.js"></script>.

Challenges Faced and How They Were Overcome:

One challenge I faced was ensuring that all elements were correctly written so that JavaScript could interact with them. For example, I learned that even small mistakes in attributes—such as incorrect IDs or missing quotes—can stop the DOM functions from working. I fixed this by carefully checking each button and making sure the IDs matched exactly. Another challenge was organizing the HTML in a way that kept the DOM structure clear and readable. Using proper nesting, meaningful headings, and consistent indentation helped me create a cleaner and more functional layout. Overall, this activity strengthened my understanding of how HTML and JavaScript work together to make webpages interactive.
