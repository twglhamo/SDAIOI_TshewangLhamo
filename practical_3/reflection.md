Things I Learned:

While creating my student profile webpage using HTML, I gained a better understanding of how basic HTML elements work together to form a complete webpage. This assignment helped me practice using headings, paragraphs, ordered lists, unordered lists, and images to present information clearly. I also learned how inline CSS can be used to apply simple styling, such as changing font colors and adjusting the overall look of the page.

New Skills or Knowledge Acquired:

Learned how to structure a simple HTML webpage using tags like <h1>, <p>, <ol>, <ul>, and <img>.

Gained experience in inserting images and adjusting their width and height.

Improved my ability to organize content using both ordered and unordered lists, including nested lists.

Practiced using basic inline CSS to add color and improve the visual appeal of the webpage.

Challenges Faced and How They Were Overcome:

One challenge I faced was making sure the HTML structure was correct and that the webpage displayed properly in the browser. Some tags were not closed correctly at first, which caused layout issues. I fixed this by carefully checking each tag and making sure the nesting was correct. Another challenge was aligning the content and choosing appropriate color styles so the page looked clean and readable. I used simple styling and avoided complex layouts to keep everything consistent. Overall, this assignment helped me strengthen my foundational HTML skills and gave me more confidence in creating and styling basic webpages.
