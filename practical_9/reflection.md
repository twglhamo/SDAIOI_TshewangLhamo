# Reflection on the Form Validation Project

Things I Learned:

Working on this form validation project helped me understand how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create a fully interactive and user-friendly form. I learned how to structure form fields using HTML, apply visual feedback using CSS classes, and perform real-time validation through JavaScript functions. This assignment showed me how important validation is for improving user experience and preventing errors during form submission.

New Skills or Knowledge Acquired:

Learned how to use HTML form elements such as labels, inputs, and error messages to build a clear and accessible form.

Understood how CSS classes like .valid and .invalid visually guide users with red and green borders.

Gained experience writing JavaScript validation functions that check input length, email format, and password rules.

Learned how to use properties like nextElementSibling to display error messages directly under each input.

Practiced enabling and disabling the submit button based on whether the form is valid.

Improved my understanding of how events, form controls, and DOM manipulation work in JavaScript.

Challenges Faced and How They Were Overcome:

One challenge I faced was making sure each input field updated correctly when the user typed something. Sometimes the error messages did not appear or the border colors did not change as expected. I solved this by checking each validation function carefully and ensuring that the right CSS classes were being added or removed. Another challenge was handling multiple fields such as password and confirm password, which required checking if both matched in real time. Debugging this helped me understand the importance of clean logic and proper sequencing when writing JavaScript. Overall, this project strengthened my confidence in building interactive frontend features and gave me a deeper understanding of real-world form validation techniques.
